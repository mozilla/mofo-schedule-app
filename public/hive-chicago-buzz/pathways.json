      "The connected learning framework fosters participatory and hands-on learning; it empowers students to play, make, network, and innovate in the world around them. Schools and teachers are compelled to adopt this framework. They recognize that 21st Century learners need access to many new kinds of skills: digital media literacy, design thinking, and creative, hands-on explorations of science and technology."
